                    <p>But before we get into the nitty-gritty of remote employee retention strategies, let’s talk about
                        the elephant in the room:<br></p>
                    <p><em>Why do employees leave?</em><br></p>
                    <p>There’s a couple of <a
                            href="https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/content/news/january-the-most-popular-month-for-job-changes"
                            target="_blank">obvious reasons</a> why someone would leave a company: low pay, negative
                        relationships with their colleagues, looking for a new challenge, wanting to be a part of a
                        different work culture.<br></p>
                    <p>But then there’s the reasons we seem to neglect:<br></p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li><a href="https://info.workinstitute.com/hubfs/2019%20Retention%20Report/Work%20Institute%202019%20Retention%20Report%20final-1.pdf"

                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Remote employee retention strategies aren’t costly and will help you fix all of the
                            issues above. Here’s how.</strong></p>
                    <h2>Get your team members involved in projects that will help them shine</h2>
                    <p>Learning and development is constantly being referenced as a primary factor to consider when
                        getting and keeping a job. Give your employees a solid role within your company so they won’t
                        hide behind projects they'll never get public credit for.<br></p>
                    <p>Putting them face-to-face with a chance to actively contribute to the company’s success keeps
                        them accountable and more engaged.<br></p>
                    <p>This can be done in many ways:<br></p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>The <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/" target="_blank">Atlassian team has a

                    <h2>Offer tailored benefits</h2>
                    <p>We’ve previously gone over some of the fun perks companies offer to stand out in an increasingly
                        competitive talent market.<br></p>
                    <p>But where do organizations go wrong?<br></p>
                    <p>A few mistakes companies make when providing employee benefits are:<br></p>
                    <ul role="list">
                        <li>Failing to customize them to every employee’s need</li>
                        <li>Purchasing benefits that work for your current culture but omitting unconventional options
                        </li>
                        <li>Forgetting to ask employees for their feedback or using enough data before making a purchase
                        </li>
                        <li>Not communicating and promoting the benefit packages to your team</li>
                        <li>Replacing expensive, mandatory benefits with cheaper ones employees might not like</li>
                        <li>Not keeping track of the performance of these benefits<br></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Remote employee benefits aren’t a one-size-fits-all and they certainly aren’t created equal. We
                        let you focus on keeping your team happy and engaged by taking over the benefits duty. Panther

                    <h2>Rethink your hiring [and onboarding] process</h2>

                            article</a>, we talked about how “poor leadership” was one of the main cons employees cited
                        on Glassdoor company pages. And it’s also one of the leading causes for team members leaving
                        organizations that otherwise seem like an ideal place.<br></p>

                        team-manager communication look like?&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <li>Holding regular one-on-one meetings to find potential struggles an employee could have</li>

                        <li>Making time to talk to someone without delegating that task or communicating through a

                        <li>Genuinely inquiring about a team member’s health and wellbeing</li>

                    <p>Another one of the leading duties of a manager is to be a mentor. Starting a mentorship program
                        should be a no-brainer given that <a

                            target="_blank">89% of employees</a> with mentors feel like their work is valued.</p>
                    <h2>Show constant recognition for an employee’s achievements, no matter how small</h2>
                    <p>To ensure the effectiveness of employee retention strategies you’ll naturally have to focus on
                        the core problems too. Showing recognition is a good place to start.&nbsp;<br></p>
                    <p>But don’t just thank your remote team after huge achievements. Recognition comes in multiple
                        forms that span across an employee’s entire lifecycle with your company.<br></p>
                    <p>You can show your appreciation by accommodating work schedules and environments to every person,
                        letting your team choose between remote-hybrid-office work attendance, or catering to their
                        professional development needs. Also, ensure your employee recognition programs align with your
                        company’s values and promises to new recruits. For example, if you boasted your reskilling and
                        wellness strategies, focus your main efforts there. These are two of the <a
                            href="https://www.panther.co/blog/future-of-hr" target="_blank">trending HR highlights</a>
                        to keep an eye on in the upcoming years for a good reason: they keep people happy and ensure
                        they enjoy working for your company, limiting the chance of them leaving.<br></p>
                    <p>Finally, remember to regularly check in on sentiment with your employees, whether that’s through
                        one-on-ones or engagement surveys. This helps you adapt the strategies you use to reduce
                        employee absenteeism and enhance employee retention for good.&nbsp;<br></p>
